Parkinson Classification Project using Support Vector Machines (SVM)


In this project I used a Support Vector Machine model (SVM) to classify subjects into two categories:
- 1 --> has Parkinson Disease
- 0 --> doesn't have Parkinson Disease


Requirements: NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn

The dataset containing vocal measurements and information on whether the person has Parkinson's or not was taken from:
Little, M. A., McSharry, P. E., Hunter, E. J., Spielman, J., & Ramig, L. O. (2009). Suitability of dysphonia measurements for telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease. IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering, 56(4), 1015. https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.2005954

Workfow:
1- Import dependencies
2- Data collection from the dataset in .CSV
3- Data analysis and preprocessing (separate feat and target variable, data standarization)
4- Model training using SVM
5- Model's performance evaluation on both training and testing datausing accuracy metric
6- Creation of predictive system where the user can input vocal measurements to obtain a prediction of wether the person has Parkinson Disease or not
