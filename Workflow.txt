To create the model: 
    Get Parkinson's data 
    Pre process data
    Split the dataset in 2 training test groups
    Support vector machine classifier


Then with the trained model:
    new data --> model --> prediction Prakinson vs healthy 


Data attributes:
    name - ASCII subject name and recording number
    status - The health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy

    Measures of variation in fundamental frequency:
        MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency
        MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
        MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
        MDVP:Jitter(%)
        MDVP:Jitter(Abs)
        MDVP:RAP --> relative aplitude perturbation
        MDVP:PPQ --> period perturbation quotient
        Jitter:DDP --> average abs difference of difference between cycles, divided by the average period
    
    Measures of variations in amplitude
        MDVP:Shimmer
        MDVP:Shimmer(dB)
        Shimmer:APQ3 --> 3 point amplitude perturbation quotient 
        Shimmer:APQ5 --> 5 point amplitude perturbation quotient 
        MDVP:APQ 
        Shimmer:DDA 
    
    Measures of the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
        NHR --> Noise to harmonics
        HNR --> harmonics to ratio

    Nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
        RPDE --> recurrence period density
        D2 --> correlation dimension
        
     Signal fractal scaling exponent --> DFA (detrended fluctuation analysis)
     Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation --> spread1,spread2, PPE (pitch period entropy)
