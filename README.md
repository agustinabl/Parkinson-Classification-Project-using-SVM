# Parkinson Classification Project using Support Vector Machines (SVM) 🧠🤖

In this project, a Support Vector Machine model (SVM) is employed to classify subjects into two categories:

- **1** --> has Parkinson Disease 
- **0** --> doesn't have Parkinson Disease 

## Requirements 🛠️
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset 📊
The dataset, encompassing vocal measurements and Parkinson's disease information, is sourced from:
[Little, M. A., McSharry, P. E., Hunter, E. J., Spielman, J., & Ramig, L. O. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.2005954)

## Workflow 🚀
1. **Import Dependencies**
2. **Data Collection from CSV**
3. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**
    - Separate feature and target variables
    - Data standardization
4. **Model Training using SVM**
5. **Model's Performance Evaluation**
    - Accuracy metric on both training and testing data
6. **Creation of Predictive System**
    - User input for vocal measurements to predict Parkinson Disease status

## How to Use 📋
1. Install required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/parkinson-classification.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd parkinson-classification
    ```

4. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Follow the prompts to input vocal measurements and obtain predictions.
